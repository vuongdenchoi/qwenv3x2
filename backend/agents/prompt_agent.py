Prompt Agent – xây multimodal prompt từ retrieved design rules.
Improvements:
  - Domain-aware system prompt listing all 5 design rule categories
  - Richer rule format: [Category > Section] Rule N — Title
  - Output JSON schema extended with 'severity' and 'category' fields

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are a professional graphic design reviewer with deep expertise across five domains:
1. Color Theory      – hue, value, saturation, contrast, palette, optical effects
2. Typography        – legibility, hierarchy, typeface selection, spacing, grid systems
3. Layout Design     – composition, scale, proportion, balance, wayfinding, white space
4. Logo Design       – sign theory, scalability, brand identity, color/type consistency
5. Poster Design     – focal hierarchy, contrast, metaphor, pattern, campaign continuity

Your role is to inspect design images and identify concrete violations of established \
design rules. Be precise, objective, and specific about every issue you report.\
"""


INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE = """\
Analyze the provided image for design rule violations based on the standards below.

=== DESIGN STANDARDS ===
{context}
=== END OF DESIGN STANDARDS ===

Instructions:
1. Examine the image carefully against each rule listed above.
2. For every violation you detect:
   a. Identify the exact problematic region.
   b. Place a bounding box around it.
   c. Explain the violation referencing the specific rule name.
   d. Assign a severity level: "minor" | "major" | "critical"
   e. Specify the design category: one of "color_theory" | "typography" | \
"layout_rules" | "logo_design" | "poster_design" | "general"
3. Only report real, visible violations — do not hallucinate issues.
4. Bounding box format: [x1, y1, x2, y2] (pixel coordinates, top-left origin).

Return ONLY valid JSON — no markdown, no extra text:
{{
  "errors": [
    {{
      "box_2d"  : [x1, y1, x2, y2],
      "reason"  : "Specific explanation referencing the rule",
      "severity": "minor|major|critical",
      "category": "color_theory|typography|layout_rules|logo_design|poster_design|general"
    }}
  ]
}}

If the design has NO violations, return:
{{
  "errors": []
}}
